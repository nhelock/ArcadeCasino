# ArcadeCasino:
 Repository for Group Collaboration on a Casino Video Game

 # Collaborators:

 Collaborators on the project with an equal part of contribution are Gage Cooper, Nate Barnhart, and Nicholas Helock

 # Version Type

 Project was deployed on 5/7/2025 with the use of Unity Editor Version 2022.3.57f1 using a personal license.
 This license allows for distribution without monetization, and as such the game has been made publicly available for all.

 # Utilization

 The project has been deployed on a "Live" branch of this repository as a .exe file.  From there it can be downloaded.
 To run the project, merely open the .exe file.  Unity's built-in handler will open the application as intended.

 # Operation Flow

 When opened, the project will open to a new game on a menu. From here you can select which game you would like to play, with a limited wallet capacity.
 Each game will be playable using the amount of money in a save file's wallet.  In the event that you run out of money, the game will start over.

 On each game's page, you can navigate back to the menu of games at any time, and you can close the game with it remembering the state of your save file.

 # Save Handling

 The game is saving by modifying the userPreferences file.  This means that 1 save will exist per .exe file.
